## How to Play

1. Type a spell name in the input and click **Guess** (or press Enter).
2. The board will show how your guess compares to the secret spell:
   - ðŸŸ© = exact match
   - ðŸŸ¦ = too high
   - ðŸŸ§ = too low
   - ðŸŸ¥ = wrong
   - Components show green (correct) or gray (incorrect) for V/S/M.
3. You have 10 tries to guess the spell.
4. Use the **All Spells** reference below to browse/filter spells and see their details.
